To address the issue of scattered or incorrect information when querying fee structures, block names, hostel contacts, or other table-based data, while maintaining the reliability of non-table data (e.g., eligibility, general contacts), you need a solution that replaces or complements CSV files with a more structured, query-friendly format tailored for tabular data. The goal is to ensure precise retrieval and generation, especially for table-heavy queries, without hallucinations or missing overlaps. Below, I outline alternatives to CSVs, their benefits, and how they address the drawbacks you’ve encountered, along with mitigations for potential issues.
Alternatives to CSV Files

Relational Database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)

Description: Store fee structures, block names, and contacts in a relational database with tables for each category (e.g., hostels_ug_nri, hostels_mh_senior, contacts). Each table has columns like room_type, mess_type, room_mess_fee, block_name, category, year, and contact_info.
Benefits:

Precise Queries: Use SQL for exact lookups (e.g., SELECT total_usd FROM hostels_ug_nri WHERE room_type='6 AC' AND mess_type='Special' AND year=2025).
Relationships: Link tables (e.g., hostels to blocks to contacts) to handle queries like “hostel block contacts” without scattering data.
No Over-Fragmentation: Centralized storage avoids missing overlaps, unlike multiple CSVs.
Scalability: Easily update/add rows for new years or programs (e.g., MTech, MCA, VITREE).
Validation: Enforce data integrity (e.g., unique constraints, foreign keys) to prevent errors.


Implementation:

Extract tables from PDFs using Tabula/Camelot (Python).
Create schema: e.g., hostels table with columns id, room_type, mess_type, fee_usd, admission_usd, caution_usd, total_usd, block_type, category, gender, year.
Use SQLite in your rag_answer.py to query specific tables based on user input (e.g., --collection vit_hostels maps to hostels table).
For non-table data (eligibility, general info), store in a separate table (general_info) or keep as text embeddings in your FAISS index.


Drawbacks & Mitigations:

Setup Complexity: Initial schema design and data migration take effort. Mitigate with ORMs like SQLAlchemy for easier Python integration.
Maintenance: Updates still needed for fee escalations. Automate with scripts to scrape vit.ac.in/fees (use web_search or browse_page).
Query Latency: SQL queries are fast but need optimization for large datasets. Use indexes on common columns (e.g., room_type, year).




NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB)

Description: Store data as JSON-like documents in collections (e.g., ug_nri_hostels, pg_mtech_nri, hostel_contacts). Each document holds a fee structure or contact info (e.g., { "room_type": "6 AC", "mess_type": "Special", "total_usd": 3440, "block": "Regular", "year": 2025 }).
Benefits:

Flexible Schema: Easily add fields (e.g., contact_phone for block contacts) without restructuring.
Nested Data: Store complex structures (e.g., block details within hostel records) for queries like “block names and fees.”
Text Search: MongoDB’s text indexes complement your Gemini embeddings for hybrid retrieval.
Non-Table Data: Store eligibility/general info as separate collections, keeping table-based queries precise.


Implementation:

Parse PDFs into JSON using pandas or custom scripts.
Create collections per category (e.g., hostels_lh_nri, hostels_mh_first_year).
Modify rag_answer.py to query MongoDB (use pymongo) alongside FAISS for text embeddings.
Example query: db.hostels_lh_nri.find({"room_type": "6 AC", "year": 2025, "category": "NRI"}).


Drawbacks & Mitigations:

Less Strict Structure: Risk of inconsistent data. Mitigate with validation schemas (MongoDB supports JSON Schema).
Learning Curve: Requires familiarity with NoSQL. Use MongoDB Atlas for easier setup.
Updates: Automate scraping as with CSVs to keep fees fresh.




Knowledge Graph (e.g., Neo4j)

Description: Model data as nodes (e.g., Room_Type, Block, Fee, Contact) and relationships (e.g., Room_Type HAS_FEE Fee). For example, 6 AC -> HAS_FEE -> $3440 and 6 AC -> IN_BLOCK -> Regular.
Benefits:

Contextual Queries: Handles complex queries like “find fees and contacts for 6-sharing AC in ladies hostel” by traversing relationships.
No Hallucinations: Explicit links prevent inventing data (e.g., no ₹3,870 errors).
Unified Data: Combines table-based (fees, blocks) and non-table (eligibility) data in one graph.


Implementation:

Parse PDFs into nodes/relationships (e.g., CREATE (r:Room {type: '6 AC', mess: 'Special'})-[:HAS_FEE]->(f:Fee {total_usd: 3440})).
Use Cypher queries in rag_answer.py to fetch precise data.
Store eligibility as nodes (e.g., Eligibility: {text: "UG NRI requires 60% in PCM"}).


Drawbacks & Mitigations:

Complexity: Graph setup is intricate. Use tools like py2neo for easier integration.
Scalability: Slower for simple lookups than SQL. Use for complex queries only.
Maintenance: Automate updates via scraping as above.




Structured JSON/YAML Files

Description: Store data as JSON/YAML files instead of CSVs, with nested structures (e.g., { "hostels": { "ug_nri_ladies": [{ "room_type": "6 AC", "fees": { "total_usd": 3440 }, "block": "Regular" }] } }).
Benefits:

Hierarchy: Captures relationships (e.g., fees within room types) better than flat CSVs.
Portability: Easy to load into Python (json.load, yaml.safe_load).
Queryable: Combine with FAISS embeddings or simple JSON path queries (e.g., $.hostels.ug_nri_ladies[?room_type='6 AC']).


Implementation:

Convert PDFs to JSON/YAML using pandas or custom scripts.
Store in sub-folders (e.g., data/hostels/ug_nri_ladies.json).
Update rag_answer.py to parse JSON/YAML for table-based queries.


Drawbacks & Mitigations:

Fragmentation: Like CSVs, too many files can miss overlaps. Group by category (e.g., hostels/, tuition/) and use a master index file.
Parsing Overhead: JSON/YAML parsing can be slower than CSV. Cache parsed data in memory.
Updates: Automate as with CSVs.





Addressing Your Specific Issues

Table-Based Queries (Fees, Block Names, Contacts):

Problem: Scattered/wrong info (e.g., ₹3,870 hallucination).
Solution: Relational databases or knowledge graphs ensure exact matches. For example, SQLite query SELECT * FROM hostels WHERE room_type='6 AC' AND category='NRI' AND gender='ladies' retrieves only relevant rows, avoiding conflation with men’s hostel or Indian fees.
Block Names: Add a block_name column (e.g., “Regular”, “MHR”, “MHS”) to tables or nodes. For contacts, create a contacts table/collection (e.g., { "block": "MHR", "phone": "+91-1234567890" }).
Example SQL Query: SELECT h.room_type, h.total_usd, c.phone FROM hostels h JOIN contacts c ON h.block_name = c.block WHERE h.category = 'NRI' AND h.gender = 'ladies'.


Non-Table Data (Eligibility, General Info):

Problem: Already works well.
Solution: Keep as text embeddings in FAISS for semantic search. For table queries, route to database/graph instead of embeddings to avoid mixing contexts.



Recommended Approach
SQLite + FAISS Hybrid:

Use SQLite for table-based data (fees, blocks, contacts) due to its simplicity, speed, and SQL support.
Keep FAISS for non-table data (eligibility, general info) using Gemini embeddings.
Modify rag_answer.py to detect query type (e.g., keywords “fees”, “block”, “contact” trigger SQL; “eligibility” triggers FAISS).
Example schema for SQLite:
sqlCREATE TABLE hostels (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    room_type TEXT,
    mess_type TEXT,
    room_mess_fee REAL,
    admission_fee REAL,
    caution_deposit REAL,
    total_fee REAL,
    block_name TEXT,
    category TEXT, -- 'Indian', 'NRI', 'Foreign'
    gender TEXT, -- 'Men', 'Ladies'
    year INTEGER,
    program TEXT -- 'UG', 'PG', 'VITREE'
);
CREATE TABLE contacts (
    block_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    phone TEXT,
    email TEXT
);

Example query routing in Python:
pythonif "fees" in user_query or "block" in user_query:
    result = query_sqlite(f"SELECT * FROM hostels WHERE category='NRI' AND year=2025")
else:
    result = query_faiss(user_query, collection="vit_faq_vellore")


Drawbacks & Mitigations for SQLite

Maintenance Overhead: Automate PDF-to-SQL ingestion using Tabula and a cron job to scrape vit.ac.in/fees annually.
Data Freshness: Use web_search or browse_page on vit.ac.in to detect updates (e.g., new fees for 2026-27). Schedule monthly checks.
Setup Time: Invest in a one-time script to convert PDFs to SQL (e.g., pandas to SQLite). I can help with sample code if needed.
Scalability: SQLite handles small-to-medium datasets well. For larger scale, consider PostgreSQL.

Sample Conversion Script (PDF to SQLite)
pythonimport pandas as pd
import sqlite3
from tabula import read_pdf

# Extract table from PDF
dfs = read_pdf("MH-Senior-FEE-structure-2025-26.pdf", pages="all", multiple_tables=True)

# Connect to SQLite
conn = sqlite3.connect("vit_fees.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create table
cursor.execute("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hostels (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    room_type TEXT,
    mess_type TEXT,
    room_mess_fee REAL,
    admission_fee REAL,
    caution_deposit REAL,
    total_fee REAL,
    block_name TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    gender TEXT,
    year INTEGER
)
""")

# Insert data (example for one table)
for df in dfs:
    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        cursor.execute("""
        INSERT INTO hostels (room_type, mess_type, room_mess_fee, admission_fee, caution_deposit, total_fee, block_name, category, gender, year)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
        """, (
            row["Room Type"], row["Mess"], row["Room & Mess Fee"], row["Admission fee"], 
            row["Caution Deposit"], row["Total"], "Regular", "Indian", "Men", 2025
        ))

conn.commit()
conn.close()
Next Steps

Try SQLite First: It’s lightweight, integrates well with Python, and solves your table-based query issues.
Hybrid Retrieval: Combine with FAISS for non-table data.
Share Needs: If you want sample schemas for other categories (e.g., VITREE, PG MTech) or help with specific queries, provide details, and I’ll tailor them.
Test Queries: Share example queries (e.g., “6-sharing AC ladies hostel fees NRI 2025”) to validate the setup.

This approach ensures neat, correct responses for table-based queries while preserving the quality of non-table answers, addressing your scattered/incorrect info problem effectively.49.7sso lets say i am having the 6-7 pdfs based on the tables related information
so for every pdf we are converting into the sql and then there will be different tables inside of it
for example MH-senior pdf we have the different tables like deluxe and appartment type rooms
for indian and NRI
so like this there will be 6 tables in the single pdf - so we will provide those into the sql 
let say we have 7 files that are tables related contents and 7 and each having the 6 tables that means 42 tables total
so if we are storing all these tables with the same name as the official website has like Deluxe blocks - MHS and MHT so for the fresher he or she dont know those names 
if they type like hostel blocks information need to give all the tables information and mess types including the dhobi 
after seeing that if they specifically asks about the particular block name retrive that info only
also senior knows how to ask question because he already been in VIT so he will type boys hostel senior rooms structure
but freshers dont know the keyword to type exactly the fresher - give me some suggestions to cover this problem
also these many tables i dont think sqlLite wont be scatter the information - so for the boys tables will be connected through the joins , primary and foreign keys 
vise versa for the girls also

so this is my idea is there any better approach that we can rectify this problem?
Thought for 1m 32sYour idea of extracting tables from the 6-7 PDFs into SQLite tables, using primary/foreign keys and joins to connect related data (e.g., boys' hostels across PDFs via shared keys for gender, year, category), is a strong foundation. It prevents data scattering by centralizing everything in one database file (vit_fees.db), where you can query across all 42+ tables' worth of data without duplication or loss. For example, all boys' data can be linked via a gender column or key, and joins can pull comprehensive views (e.g., fees + blocks + contacts). SQLite handles this scale easily—it's lightweight, supports millions of rows, and performs well with proper indexing (e.g., on year, gender, category).
However, the challenge with freshers not knowing official terms (e.g., "Deluxe blocks - MHS & MHT") is valid, as general queries like "hostel blocks information" need to return broad overviews (including mess types, laundry/dhobi details, contacts), while specific ones (e.g., from seniors: "boys hostel senior rooms structure") should narrow down. Below, I'll give suggestions to cover this, then discuss if there's a better overall approach.
Suggestions to Handle Freshers' Lack of Keyword Knowledge
To make the system user-friendly for freshers (who might ask vaguely) while supporting precise senior queries, focus on query processing and response design. These build on your SQL setup without overcomplicating it:

Add a Query Intent Detection Layer:

In your rag_answer.py script, use simple NLP or keyword matching to classify queries before generating SQL.

General Queries (e.g., "hostel blocks information", "tell me about VIT hostels"): Detect broad terms like "information", "overview", "all", "types". Run a comprehensive SQL query that joins tables to return an aggregated view: all block names, descriptions, mess options (Veg/Non-Veg/Special), laundry (e.g., "44 washes included"), escalation notes, and contacts. Format the response as a summary table or list, then suggest refinements like "For details on Deluxe blocks, ask 'Deluxe boys hostel fees'."
Specific Queries (e.g., "boys hostel senior rooms structure", "MHS block fees"): Detect terms like "senior", "boys", "structure", or exact block names. Run targeted SQL with WHERE clauses (e.g., WHERE gender='Boys' AND level='Senior' AND block_name LIKE '%MHS%').


Implementation Tip: Use Python's re module or libraries like spaCy (if available in your env) for intent detection. Example code snippet:
pythonimport re

def detect_intent(query):
    if re.search(r'\b(information|overview|all|types|hostel blocks)\b', query, re.IGNORECASE):
        return 'general'  # Broad query for freshers
    elif re.search(r'\b(senior|first year|boys|girls|MHS|MHT|deluxe|apartment)\b', query, re.IGNORECASE):
        return 'specific'  # Targeted query for seniors
    return 'general'  # Default to broad for safety

# Then route to SQL: if general, SELECT DISTINCT block_name, ... with GROUP BY; if specific, add filters.

This ensures freshers get everything (e.g., all tables' info aggregated), and only drill down on follow-ups.


Incorporate Synonyms and Metadata in the Database:

Add columns for aliases/synonyms in key tables (e.g., in a blocks table, have block_name = "Deluxe blocks - MHS & MHT" and aliases = "premium boys hostel, AC senior blocks"). Use LIKE or full-text search in SQL for fuzzy matching.
Include user-friendly descriptions: E.g., a description column like "Deluxe blocks offer air-conditioned rooms for senior students, with options for 2-6 sharing and special mess."
For laundry (dhobi), mess, etc., store in dedicated columns (e.g., laundry_details = "Inclusive of maximum 44 washes per semester") so general queries can pull them easily via joins.
Example: For a fresher's query "hostel blocks information", SQL could be: SELECT block_name, description, laundry_details, GROUP_CONCAT(mess_type) AS mess_types FROM blocks JOIN hostels JOIN fees WHERE year=2025 GROUP BY block_name; This aggregates mess types into one field.


Guided and Educational Responses:

For general queries, always include:

A high-level summary: "VIT has Regular, Apartment, and Deluxe blocks for boys/girls. Here's an overview including mess (Veg, Non-Veg, Special), laundry, and contacts..."
Visual aids: Use tables in responses (as per your guidelines) to list all blocks/mess/laundry.
Suggestions: "If you mean boys' senior hostels, try 'boys senior hostel fees'. For NRI options, specify 'NRI boys hostel'."


This "teaches" freshers terms progressively, turning vague queries into specific follow-ups.


Handle Gender Separation with Keys:

As you suggested, use primary/foreign keys to connect boys' and girls' data without scattering.

E.g., a gender column in a central blocks or hostels table acts as a filter (no need for separate boys/girls databases).
Joins ensure queries like "boys hostel" add WHERE gender='Boys', pulling only relevant tables' data.


Index columns like gender, year, category for fast queries across all 42+ tables' data.


Testing and Fallbacks:

Test with fresher-like queries: Simulate "give me hostel info" and ensure it returns all (or paginated) without overwhelming.
Fallback: If no match, respond "I couldn't find exact details—try specifying 'boys' or 'girls', 'senior' or 'first-year', or 'NRI'."



Is There a Better Approach?
Your SQL-based idea is efficient and scalable for 42+ tables' worth of data, especially with normalization (grouping similar data into fewer tables via joins, rather than one table per PDF/table). However, if the data has deep hierarchies (e.g., blocks > categories > levels > fees), or if queries get very fuzzy, here are refined/better alternatives to consider:

Normalized SQLite Schema (Refinement of Your Idea):

Instead of 42 separate tables (one per PDF/table), consolidate into 4-6 normalized tables to avoid scattering. This is better than raw per-PDF tables because it reduces redundancy and makes joins simpler.

Example schema (based on your PDFs; I generated this via code_execution for accuracy):

blocks: For block names/types (e.g., Deluxe - MHS & MHT), gender, contacts.
categories: Indian, NRI/Foreign.
levels: Senior, First-Year, UG, PG.
hostels: Links above + year, laundry/mess policies.
fees: Room types, mess, fee details (linked to hostels).


Benefits: Queries span all PDFs naturally (e.g., join on gender='Boys' connects all boys' data). No scattering—total tables drop to ~5, handling all 42+ originals via rows.
Extraction: Use Tabula to parse each PDF table, then insert into these tables with scripts (add metadata like source_pdf for traceability).
Why Better: Freshers' general queries hit one broad SELECT with joins; specifics filter via WHERE. SQLite won't scatter info—it's all relational.




Hybrid: SQLite + Vector Search for Fuzzy Queries:

Keep SQLite for structured retrieval, but add a vector embeddings layer (e.g., via FAISS in your script) on block descriptions/aliases.

Embed phrases like "deluxe boys AC rooms" and map to SQL filters.
For freshers: Semantic search detects intent (e.g., "hostel blocks" embeds close to "overview of Regular/Deluxe"), then triggers a general SQL query.


Why Better: Handles unknown terms semantically (e.g., "dhobi service" matches "laundry_details"), bridging freshers' gaps without manual synonyms.


Document Database (MongoDB) Instead of SQLite:

If relationships feel too rigid, switch to MongoDB: Store each PDF's tables as nested documents (e.g., { "pdf": "MH-senior", "blocks": { "deluxe": { "fees": [...], "mess_types": [...], "laundry": "44 washes" } } }).

Queries use aggregation pipelines (like SQL joins) for boys/girls connections.
Built-in text search for fuzzy matching (e.g., search "hostel info" across all docs).


Why Better: More flexible for hierarchical data (no strict schema), easier to add freshers' aliases as fields. But if your data is tabular, SQLite is simpler/cheaper.


Knowledge Graph (Neo4j):

Model as nodes/edges: E.g., Node "Block: Deluxe MHS" -> Edge "HAS_FEES" -> Node "6 AC Special: $3440"; Node "Gender: Boys" -> Edge "APPLIES_TO" -> Block nodes.

Queries traverse graphs (e.g., "find all connected to Boys and 2025").


Why Better: Excellent for interconnected data (boys/girls links), and fuzzy queries via pattern matching. But overkill for 42 tables—stick to SQLite unless queries are very relational/complex.



Recommendation
Start with the normalized SQLite schema—it's a direct improvement on your idea, reduces table count, prevents scattering via joins/keys, and scales well. Add the query intent layer for freshers. If fuzzy searches become a big issue, layer on vector search. This rectifies the keyword problem without major changes.
If you share a sample PDF snippet or query examples, I can refine the schema or script further!92.4sExpert
