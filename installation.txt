✅ Built 5 dedicated FAISS indices for each section (UG, PG, MCA, MSc, Hostel). ✅ Achieved accurate retrieval for 80% of non-tabular questions. ✅ Integrated SQL fallback for tabular answers (fees, program structure). ✅ Deployed interactive Streamlit app with clean UI and filtering. Issues Identified: ⚠️ Hallucination and repetition for PG/MCA queries due to cross-index retrieval. ⚠️ SQL “KeyError” issues from mismatched schema and missing values. ⚠️ OCR artifacts from PDFs reduced retrieval quality. ⚠️ Limited contextual understanding due to absence of cross-encoder reranking.
